Now you know why Emscripten is :ref:`right for you <about-emscripten>`, it's time to *get started*.

This section provides a walk-through of :ref:`downloading and installing the SDK <sdk-download-and-install>` and the basics of :ref:`using the Emscripten toolchain <Tutorial>`. The general :ref:`FAQ` answers many common questions about setting up and using Emscripten.

We also explain where to :ref:`Report Bugs <bug-reports>` in the toolchain and the site, and how to use Emscripten with :ref:`Visual Studio 2010 <getting-started-emscripten-from-visual-studio>` (Windows only). The :ref:`emscripten-test-suite` is a great resource for finding examples of how to use Emscripten.
