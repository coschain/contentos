Bug Reporting
=============

All bugs should be filed in the GitHub `main <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten>`_ Emscripten repository `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues?state=open>`_.

Please supply as much relevant information as possible, including:

- Original source code.
- Generated bitcode (**.bc**, **.o** or **.ll**)
- Environment information â€” including *emcc* and *clang* versions (as reported by ``emcc -v``).
- Error symptoms.
- Proposed solutions, ideally with a pull request.

.. Tip:: Compile with ``EMCC_DEBUG=1`` and grab the **/tmp/emscripten_temp/emcc-\*** files (these include the bitcode and JavaScript in several stages). Note that the **emscripten_temp** directory should be emptied manually first, so it only contains new content!


Fastcomp LLVM-Backend and Clang bugs
====================================

:ref:`LLVM Backend <LLVM-Backend>` bugs may instead be posted to the appropriate `Emscripten LLVM fork <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp>`_ or `Emscripten Clang fork <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp-clang>`_ **if you are certain** that the bug is specific to these repositories. If uncertain, bugs must be posted to the `main repository <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten>`_.

Pull requests must (of course) go to the proper repository.
