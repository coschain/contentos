Emscripten Toolchain Requirements
=================================

The instructions below list the main tools and dependencies in an Emscripten environment, along with instructions on how to test which dependencies are installed.

.. tip:: The :ref:`SDK <sdk-download-and-install>` provides the **easiest** and **most reliable** method for getting, using, updating and managing Emscripten environments. If you're using the SDK you won't *need* these instructions â€” they are provided for information only.

	The instructions below are useful if you're :ref:`manually <installing-from-source>` building from source.

What you'll need

.. _central-list-of-emscripten-tools-and-dependencies:

Emscripten tools and dependencies
---------------------------------

A complete Emscripten environment requires the following tools. First test to see if they are already installed using the :ref:`instructions below <toolchain-test-which-dependencies-are-installed>`. Then install any missing tools using the instructions in the appropriate platform-specific build topic (:ref:`building-emscripten-on-linux`, :ref:`building-emscripten-on-windows-from-source`, :ref:`building-emscripten-on-mac-osx-from-source`):

	- :term:`Node.js` (0.8 or above; 0.10.17 or above to run websocket-using servers in node):
	- :term:`Python` 2.x (2.7.3 or above preferred)
	- :term:`Java` (1.6.0_31 or later).  Java is optional. It is required to use the :term:`Closure Compiler` (in order to minify your code).
	- :term:`Git` client. Git is required if building tools from source.
	- :term:`Fastcomp` (Emscripten's fork of LLVM and Clang)
	- The `Emscripten code <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten>`_, from GitHub 

.. note: 64-bit versions of all needed dependencies are preferred, and may be required if you are building large projects. 

.. note:: The `Spidermonkey shell <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell>`_ is also required if you want to run **100%** of the tests in the test suite. Most developers will not need this, and should instead use *node.js*.

.. _compiler-toolchain:

Compiler toolchain
------------------

When building Emscripten from source code, whether "manually" or using the SDK, you will need a *compiler toolchain*:

- Windows: Install `Visual Studio 2010 <http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709949>`_ and `cmake <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_. You may also need `Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279>`_).

	.. note:: 
	
		- Visual Studio 2010 is required! Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013 do not correctly compile :ref:`Fastcomp <LLVM-Backend>`. This issue will be fixed (eventually) when *Fastcomp* is migrated to use a LLVM 3.4 or later.
		- SDK users can also install and activate the MinGW compiler toolchain in order to build their own projects:

			::
			
				emsdk install mingw-4.6.2-32bit
				emsdk activate mingw-4.6.2-32bit
				
			While this toolchain can in theory also be used to build :ref:`Fastcomp <LLVM-Backend>`, Visual Studio 2010 is recommended (by the LLVM development team).

		
- Linux: Install *gcc* and *cmake*:
	
	::
		
		#Install gcc
		sudo apt-get install build-essential
		# Install cmake
		sudo apt-get install cmake
	
- Mac OS X: Install the *XCode Command Line Tools*:

	-  Install XCode from the `Mac OS X App Store <http://superuser.com/questions/455214/where-is-svn-on-os-x-mountain-lion>`_.
	-  In **XCode | Preferences | Downloads**, install *Command Line Tools*.

.. note:: Building LLVM and Clang from source can require a lot of memory and hard drive space. The specific requirements change from LLVM version to another, but you probably need at least 2GB of RAM, preferably 4GB or more. Debug builds or builds with assertions can require even more memory.

.. _toolchain-test-which-dependencies-are-installed:

Test which tools are installed
==============================

Some of the tools are pre-installed on the various platforms (for example, Python is always available on Linux builds). 

You can check which tools are already present using the following commands:

::

	# Check for Python
	python --version
		
	# Check for node.js on Linux
	nodejs --version
	
	# Check for node.js on Windows
	node --version
	
	# Check for node.js on Mac OS X
	node -v
	
	# Check for git
	git --version
		
	# Check for Java
	java -version

	# Check for gcc / g++
	gcc --version
	g++
	
	# Check for cmake
	cmake
